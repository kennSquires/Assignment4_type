<h1>Intent & Process</h1>

        <p>
            The intention for my final class assignment of Advanced Web; 
            Typography & Animation is to portray cats' personalities through imagery, 
            typography, color and animations. Cats are certainly passive aggressive animals 
            with strong boundaries and many needs, which I tried to show through the playful
            typography and light color choices. I decided to only do line drawings of cats to
            allow for the type/color to stand out and rather let the imagery support the animations. 
            My process while designing the website was to first draw a wireframe to confirm my ideas, 
            then I moved forward with my final drawings. After they were complete, I focused on finding variable
            fonts that would express my concept. The final step that I took to complete the project was to code the 
            layout and animations for my website.
